# firstCalculator
I created a calculator using HTML and JavaScript

This is the first iteration of the program - so there are clear issues, like the fact that I'm using the "eval" function. 
I also would like to rewrite this program using the HTML .innerText property instead of storing the numbers and operators in a "let" variable. In other words,
I would like to display the expression in an <h2> tag and use the .innerText property to collect the expression and later evaluate it.

I will come back to this project in the future and make improvements.
